# Welcome!

## About me

My name is Florian and I am a 20-year-old hobby coder based in Switzerland. Since about 2015, I've been teaching myself how to code.

The main languages I've been learning are Python and Java, and more recently, Kotlin and R. I've also looked into many other languages like Shell/Bash, LaTeX, C/C++, C#, SQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart, etc.

This fall (September 2023), I'll start my studies at university. Let's hope I still find some time to code... ðŸ˜„

## Some projects

Here's some information about my projects that are available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/fflopsi):

### Tournaments

Tournaments is an Android App built with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for managing croquet tournaments with multiple players and multiple games per tournament. I'm currently converting this to a [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) project. More information about it can be found [here](/tournaments).

### ArchCustomization

Just a simple collection of some Bash scripts to customize an [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com) / [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) installation to my liking, e.g. installing some packages, theming and customizing [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) and installing some [extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/), some configuration, etc. All these scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/fflopsi/arch-customization).

### TwoBodyProblem

This was my matriculation project (project at the end of Swiss high school). It is a simulation of the gravitational [two-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem), written in Python with [VPython](https://vpython.org). You can adjust options to define how the simulation looks/works and values to define the physical properties of the two bodies. The simulation itself can be found [here](https://github.com/fflopsi/twobodyproblem), a graphical utility for entering the options and values is available [here](https://github.com/fflopsi/twobodyproblem-gui).

### WorldUtils

WorldUtils is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org) plugin containing some handy utilities for your Minecraft server, i.e. saving and viewing global and personal positions, sending your positions to other players, controlling a global and personal timer and resetting the whole world/server. The plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/fflopsi/worldutils).

WorldUtils Projects is an extension to WorldUtils and contains some long-term Minecraft projects. At the moment, there is only one: AllItems, whith the objective to collect all obtainable items in the game. This plugin is available [here](https://github.com/fflopsi/worldutils-projects).
