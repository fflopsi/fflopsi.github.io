## Welcome!

My name is Florian and I am a 20-year-old hobby coder based in Switzerland. Since about 2015, I've been teaching myself how to code.

The main languages I've been learning are Python and Java, and more recently, Kotlin and R. I've also looked into many other languages like Shell/Bash, LaTeX, C/C++, C#, SQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart, etc.

## Some projects

Here's some information about my projects that are available on GitHub:

### Tournaments

Tournaments is an Android App built with Jetpack Compose for managing croquet tournaments with multiple players and multiple games per tournament. I'm currently converting this to a [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) project. More information about it can be found [here](/tournaments)
